# Key Concepts JDK, JRE, JVM

- JDK (Java Development Kit): A full-featured software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes the JRE, an interpreter/loader (Java Virtual Machine), a compiler (javac), and other tools.
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run Java applications. It does not include development tools like the compiler.
- JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The engine that runs Java bytecode. It interprets compiled Java programs (bytecode) and executes them on the host machine.
- Bytecode: Bytecode is the intermediate, platform-independent code generated by the Java compiler (javac). It is not machine code but a set of instructions that the JVM can interpret and execute.
- Write Once, Run Anywhere: This phrase means that Java code, once compiled into bytecode, can run on any device or operating system that has a compatible JVM. This allows developers to write their program once and run it anywhere without modification, promoting portability and cross-platform compatibility.`
